/**
 * Plugin ordering is load-bearing on Cloudflare:
 *  1. cloudflare()       — must come first so it owns the "ssr" Vite environment
 *                          before tanstackStart() configures it.
 *  2. tanstackStart()    — generates the SSR + client entry points + route tree
 *                          (reads `tsr.config.json`, which targets React).
 *  3. react()            — JSX transform.
 *  4. lunora({cloudflare:false}) — codegen, wrangler validation, studio overlay.
 *                          `cloudflare: false` tells Lunora not to re-add
 *                          @cloudflare/vite-plugin (it's already position 0 above).
 *
 * The `virtual:lunora/worker` entry (set in wrangler.jsonc `main`) is resolved
 * by the frameworkComposePlugin inside lunora() — it emits a composed worker
 * that routes `/_lunora/*` to Lunora and everything else to the TanStack Start
 * SSR handler (@tanstack/react-start/server-entry).
